## Why RHF+?

React Hook Form is a robust and delightful form library for React. However, maintaining high-quality standards for such a popular package requires careful consideration that can slow feature development. RHF+ was created to bridge this gap by providing enhanced functionality while maintaining full compatibility with the original library.

> [!Warning]
>
> The unavoidable outcome of adding new form states, methods, and data events includes:
>
> - Increased package size
> - Additional form renders
>
> As we add new enhancements, we work to optimize these features to minimize the impact on form performance.
